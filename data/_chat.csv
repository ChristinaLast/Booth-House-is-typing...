NAME: FAHAD TAHIR,
DATE: 05/09/19 8.30 am,
OUTSIDE ORGANISATION: MK FIRE LTD (ON BEHALF OF SALVATION ARMY),
SERVICE AGREEMENT: 072057509,
REPRESENTIVE: GRANT BAID,
DETAILS:,
Grant arrived at around 8.30 where he presented documentation to Jem as she left the building. After being let in Fahad accompanied him in his inspection around the building as they checked each kitchen for fire blankets and extinguishers. ,
GRANT‰ÛªS CONCERNS:,
It was worrying to myself to hear about the concerns raised by Grant as we walked through the building. Considering the door stop ban it is extremely worrying that a professional voiced his doubts about the building. Suggesting that while the coverage is legal it may not be effective.,
‰Û¢,Fire extinguishers not found in corridors
‰Û¢,In some kitchens only a fire blanket can be found
‰Û¢,30-40 extinguishers have been found in the basement
With respect to the last point it seems illogical for DDD to have removed the extinguishers from the corridors only to leave them in the kitchens. Should DD have removed them due to untrained guardians being the obvious user why would the extinguishers remain in kitchens?,
Grant will be voicing his concerns to Louise later on today.,
GUARDIAN ACTIONS:,
‰Û¢,Request a copy of the fire risk assessment
"After liaising with a college of his Grant confirmed to myself that as each escape has an extinguisher DDD are compliant with fire regulation. However, in his professional opinion the corridors are too long for the extinguishers to provide any real coverage. The above action appears to be the only way that guardians can find out who is liable should the worst occur.",
CLOSING COMMENTS:,
"Considering the recent fire issues in London and the fact that our building is respectively old, I believe that this is a cause for concern for Guardians. I would like to note however that Grant was extremely impressed with the time and dedication that has been invested in the building and the level of trust exhibited between guardians as he cited that many people leave their rooms unlocked. He was also very impressed by the art exhibition and would like to pass on his appreciation.",

The nearest physical clinics are around Canary Wharf and near Kings Cross for blood tests, poking and prodding.  You can often get appointments quickly, certainly conveniently, they have always been within a couple of minutes of ""on time"", you can have phone or video chat, you can be referred to specialists, get prescriptions, etc.  I've had a different doctor each time and they haven't read my file, so that is absolutely no different from going into my previous clinic.  Plus you can talk to a doctor even if you're out of town.  It takes about 24 hours to get on their roster.",

"We would like to remind all guardians at Booth House of our drugs policy. We have recently come across a few separate incidents of illegal drug use in the building. Whilst each incident is dealt with individually, it's important for us to communicate what our drug policy is more widely.åÊ",
"There is a zero tolerance on illegal drug use in Booth House and anyone found to be storing, possessing or taking drugs in the building puts their housing with Dot Dot Dot at risk.åÊ",
"Smoking of any kind inside the building is also against our rules, our fire regulations and our agreement with the building‰Ûªs owners. It also risks setting off the building‰Ûªs sensitive fire alarm system, causing great nuisance to all 90 guardians.",
"The building‰Ûªs owners, SAHA, regularly visit the building. If they were to discover any use of illegal drugs in the building this could cause detrimental damage to our relationship with our client and put the whole project at risk. This could potentially cause every resident to receive 28 days notice to hand back Booth House and cause Dot Dot Dot substantial reputational damage.åÊ",
Drugs are illegal inside Booth House just as they are outside of it. Dot Dot Dot have been working hard with other organisations to tackle the anti-social behaviour and obvious drug use outside the building. We know many of you have huge concerns about the anti-social behaviour and therefore it is very important we do everything we can to discourage this behaviour. Drug use inside Booth House goes directly against our positive work of tackling anti-social behaviour outside the building.,
Thank you very much for your understanding on this matter and if you need any further clarification please don‰Ûªt hesitate to get in touch.,
Dot Dot Dot,

"Dear Boothers,",
"The Art Exhibition is for everybody. You do not have to consider yourself as an artist. But I promise you, you will feel like one after you participate. If you have created something which you could exhibit or sell, including literature, performing and other forms of art, please come to the meeting at 7pm today. ",
"The art world can be pretentious but that‰Ûªs not us. We will not let you down but will lift you and your creations up. All we ask in return is commitment. Late comers won‰Ûªt be able to participate this time round, so if you are interested and cannot attend today please contact me as there will be an alternative date for others who couldn‰Ûªt attend.",

,
We first raised a works order for the heating to be switched on on the 9th October. I have escalated the lack of heating at Booth House and have been assured an engineer will attend next Tuesday 29th to get the heating working.åÊ,
,
"I am sorry this is taking longer than expected to sort out and I know many of you have been cold. We have a limited amount of heaters left to hand out. If you do need one for the time being please ask at reception. These will be handed out on a first come, first served basis until they're gone. We would like these heaters back once Booth House becomes warm and toasty again.",
,
Thank you for your continued patience with this.,

"Kind Regards,",

They were in the process of organizing the Market back to the state they had found it.,
At some point before they had arrived apparently someone had shifted the rails and shoved the Hoovers around and clothes were added to the pile.,

 *  Roast dinner at 2pm this Sunday*,
              Please join the group ,
 and add your name in the description.,
         No money options available ,
                - Everyone welcome,
This week is with a twist...,
"A roast is an English tradition, but with such a diverse mix of housemates we would like to introduce alternative dishes. This week allow the roasted meat and veggies be the baseline and then let‰Ûªs see what else gets added.",
Coming soon... every other Sunday will become a different cuisine. If you would like to head up a particular cuisine please get in touch and let‰Ûªs make it happen. ,

So you already know about the Boothfamily dinner at 2.,
"This will be followed by Canteen Crafting.  Bring something you're working on for the art fair, something you've been putting off, something you're not sure how to do, or brainstorm with your corridormates on how you're going to decorate.  Or just hang out.",
Then at 7 it's SUPERHERO SUNDAY in the lounge.  I think we're on Age of Ultron but it's anybody's guess.,
