[31/08/2019, 20:06:32] Dotdotdot: So I accidentally left my brand new Harry Potter mug and all my plates in my kitchen cupboard and I am upset to find all of it now gone. Whoever has been using it to plate up their musty smelling food is a FUCKING TRAMP and definitely belongs in booth house... on the steps with the crackheads. FUCK YOU AND YOUR MUM!! Eating dinner is the only thing I look forward to in Booth House

[31/08/2019, 21:28:32] ‪+44 7534 190697‬: Oh what glory, is it - this, good, royal country. 
O! What wonder must it be, to be the man with the brunt and the glee, to change the course of history, with the aid of a noble monarch who can’t even remember what she had for tea...let alone allow the collapse of a democracy.
Oh what glory it is: the honour we harbor, a Brexit we didn’t vote for and a nation sailing out to sea. 
‘Tis the time’s plague...when madmen lead the blind.’

That was a cycle of washing containing all the things that were too delicate to go into the dryer. Half of it has shrunk. Please just put it on top of one of the machines or in one of the baskets if you need the washer

[05/09/2019, 09:43:49] ‪+44 7971 638784‬: GUARDIAN REPORT
NAME: FAHAD TAHIR
DATE: 05/09/19 8.30 am
OUTSIDE ORGANISATION: MK FIRE LTD (ON BEHALF OF SALVATION ARMY)
SERVICE AGREEMENT: 072057509
REPRESENTIVE: GRANT BAID
DETAILS:
Grant arrived at around 8.30 where he presented documentation to Jem as she left the building. After being let in Fahad accompanied him in his inspection around the building as they checked each kitchen for fire blankets and extinguishers. 
GRANT’S CONCERNS:
It was worrying to myself to hear about the concerns raised by Grant as we walked through the building. Considering the door stop ban it is extremely worrying that a professional voiced his doubts about the building. Suggesting that while the coverage is legal it may not be effective.
•	Fire extinguishers not found in corridors
•	In some kitchens only a fire blanket can be found
•	30-40 extinguishers have been found in the basement
With respect to the last point it seems illogical for DDD to have removed the extinguishers from the corridors only to leave them in the kitchens. Should DD have removed them due to untrained guardians being the obvious user why would the extinguishers remain in kitchens?
Grant will be voicing his concerns to Louise later on today.
GUARDIAN ACTIONS:
•	Request a copy of the fire risk assessment
After liaising with a college of his Grant confirmed to myself that as each escape has an extinguisher DDD are compliant with fire regulation. However, in his professional opinion the corridors are too long for the extinguishers to provide any real coverage. The above action appears to be the only way that guardians can find out who is liable should the worst occur.
CLOSING COMMENTS:	
Considering the recent fire issues in London and the fact that our building is respectively old, I believe that this is a cause for concern for Guardians. I would like to note however that Grant was extremely impressed with the time and dedication that has been invested in the building and the level of trust exhibited between guardians as he cited that many people leave their rooms unlocked. He was also very impressed by the art exhibition and would like to pass on his appreciation.
[05/09/2019, 09:46:03] Jen Dotdotdot: thank you so much Fahad
[05/09/2019, 09:46:17] Jen Dotdotdot: Yes it always confused me so much when they took the fire extinguishers away??
[05/09/2019, 09:49:13] ‪+44 7971 638784‬: I will drop louise a note to let her know that I have accompanied Grant on his inspection

[05/09/2019, 09:50:14] ‪+44 7971 638784‬: Do we have a google drive for documentation?
[05/09/2019, 09:50:20] ‪+420 737 501 024‬: @447971638784 thanks for detailed report 👍
[05/09/2019, 09:54:26] Jooles Dotdotdot: Did he mention anything about the exhibition being an increased fire risk? DDD seem to think it is 🤔
[05/09/2019, 09:56:38] ‪+44 7971 638784‬: yes, but there is a way of putting out a fire so it is ok
[05/09/2019, 10:24:18] ‪+44 7733 107661‬: Awesome @447971638784 . Thank you.

[05/09/2019, 13:57:37] Bryce Dotdotdot: Fire extinguishers in hallways unsafe because of the blocking issue. In a smoke filled zero-visibility evacuation, any clutter is a hazard. Obviously would be nice to have them but they’d need to be attached to walls or in recessed spaces. And also not be used to prop open fire doors 😂
[05/09/2019, 14:02:13] Dotdotdot: Do the fire extinguishers really matter for the hallways? Or are we just bored?
[05/09/2019, 14:03:18] Dotdotdot: P.S. there’s no fire extinguisher in my shower 🤬
[05/09/2019, 14:04:30] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: I’ve used Addison Lee’s courier service before. They have vans. You can get a quote on their site.

🚲🚲🚲🚲🚲

Providence Row is a homelessness organisation based round the corner from Booth House, offering a range of services to support people who have experienced homelessness. The charity has 2 broken bicycles that are in need of repair. They are no longer needed for the group that they were used for, so Providence Row would like to repair them to sell on to raise funds for our work. We are looking for a volunteer or two who could work on these bikes and repair them back to a state fit for sale. If you’re interested, or to find out more, please get in touch with Chris: cbardo@providencerow.org.uk

[08/09/2019, 14:24:23] Dotdotdot: I think it’s just dry recycling or general waste
[08/09/2019, 14:25:54] ‪+45 41 59 54 59‬: Okay. Thx 👍🏻
[08/09/2019, 14:49:13] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: We haven't worked out a way to deal with food waste.  We try not to make it.  We don't have a place to compost, we haven't committed to a wormery, and we do not have kerbside food recycling.  Danae introduced us to a zero packaging shop just along the 254 and they have community composting, also maybe the community farms, but you have to take your waste there.

It was taken over bank holiday weekend when I was away. It was a £15 bottle that was a gift. If it’s replaced tonight I’ll leave it that. If not I’ll ask Louise to check the cameras. Its not fair to take someone else’s booze and not replace it.

Next Monday (16 Sep) is anyone available to volunteer with me for a mammoth 12 hours? 😬

This will involve 6 hours of travel to Lincoln and back to hold a stall at *Lincoln Freshers Fair* for Humanist Students (party of the the Humanists UK charity).

All your travel and food/drink costs will be covered for the day. And travel time counts towards volunteering hours.

I'm aware this is a huge ask - please let me know if you would be up for it!

[15/09/2019, 13:50:34] Bryce Dotdotdot: It _should_ self-close like all the other doors. If not we should get maintenance to sort it.
[15/09/2019, 13:53:44] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Living the dream! Looks amazing.

[15/09/2019, 14:32:11] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: I was thinking more of a Guy Ritchie film. If questioned Zoe, you could come back with a Ray Winston vibe - If it looks like a duck (...), it’s a duck. Now jog on.

I wanted to clean it when I wake up. I just cleaned it, and I cleaned the ironing board also, purple stain was easily removed from board with Vanish. So good news is it should be easy to wash your shirt with Vanish also. I will deffinitelly try that, otherwise I will replace you. Also what is your favourite drink as replacement for today inconvinience. I am so sorry 🙈

[16/09/2019, 11:06:33] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: Anybody know a Photoshop wizard who could Rambo up a movie poster? It's for an epic 19th century romantic drama, entitled Peace Fury & the Dynamite King.  I envision it as a couple reaching across a divide with the title in Belle Epoque lettering going down the middle. Underneath is a  blended background of 1870s Paris fading into a battle scene a la Waterloo  and behind the  couple a man looks down upon them. It's paid work (though not market, as I just need something to hand out as postcards at Raindance later this week).  Jem? Jools? Mae? Mushroom? Thanks guys.

[16/09/2019, 12:21:51] Dotdotdot: It was very good. And that’s all you want from fish and chips. You can go fancy and miss the charm of proper local fish and chips
[16/09/2019, 12:22:42] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: I don't think they are looking for fancy, just tasty

[19/09/2019, 14:46:42] Jen Dotdotdot: Hi beautiful friends... My work are looking for three adults/friends to be in an ad for us. It's a very very simple task, no dialogue, and it's for a mental health campaign we are doing for one of our clients. Please comment if you're up for it and I can send you more details. It'll take up 4 hours of your time on Wednesday the 25th (next week) and we would give you £100 plus travel. Sorry I know it's not much, but you don't have to have experience or be a pro.

Thank youuuu happy Thursday <3

I’m hoping to run a series of workshops/talks/discussions on themes such as student protest, climate change, XR, politics in education etc…
 
If anyone feels they could offer a session or would like to be involved somehow please PM me and we can chat. Students have enrichment time on a Wednesday afternoon from 1.50pm - 3.30pm so this is when the sessions would take place. Thanks in advance

[24/09/2019, 10:07:04] Dotdotdot: Could work during the day but they normally start tweaking out around 2-5am( that’s when they wake me anyway) what if we wet the steps?
[24/09/2019, 10:08:50] Dotdotdot: Water and sugar. Sticky steps might make em find a new party spot 🤷‍♂

[25/09/2019, 09:16:18] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Sounds good Shiva
[25/09/2019, 09:23:11] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: That’s a great campaign! Thanks.
[25/09/2019, 09:24:25] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: Okay  switching to film thread to arrange.
[25/09/2019, 09:41:59] ‪+44 7960 036447‬: Sorted thankss wonderful Sharon!!
[25/09/2019, 09:42:00] Dotdotdot: This is not an apology. They insulted her on international televised news, then “apologised” in a written comment in the daily beast. Might aswell have written their apology on a bathroom stall door for all the people that will see it.
[25/09/2019, 09:44:52] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: The story of the apology has been spread far and wide.  And I'm not judging the quality of the apology.  Only sharing a news story.
[25/09/2019, 09:48:21] ‪+44 7898 248880‬: Will you exchange for 2 cans of chickpeas???
[25/09/2019, 09:49:06] ‪+44 7898 248880‬: Seriously, thank you for this Zoe, lifesaver

[25/09/2019, 09:50:27] ‪+33 6 28 80 45 67‬: Let me know if you know someone interested
[25/09/2019, 09:56:01] Dotdotdot: I know Zoe, Dw I’m commenting on the story too, not commenting on you. However, a real apology is given in the same way as the offence. Televised prime time apology, their target audience will not see or care about an anonymous spokesman’s comments in the daily beast. It isn’t even an apology on Fox News itself.
[25/09/2019, 12:51:00] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: Yo, Millys phone is broken so if you’re trying to get in contact add her on facebook 😊

[25/09/2019, 14:18:10] ‪+44 7918 776310‬: I know someone whose interested. She deals in chickpeas currency only. I’ve heard it’s the new bitcoin. x
[25/09/2019, 14:19:27] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: I can confirm chickpeas command a competitive rate on Forex.

Hi everyone, we're looking for a group of people to collaborate on a potential residency at a local gallery. Great opportunity to bring all the hard work we've done in Booth House to a wider audience!

They're looking for a group of creatives who can work together in one of their blank spaces and make something that contributes to the local community. So very much like we have all done in Booth House.

We'll have a meeting this Sunday to come up with some ideas for our application. DM me if interested. 

You don't need to be an artist, everyone is welcome!

[26/09/2019, 14:39:16] ‪+44 7483 211468‬: On Whitechapel market there is a watch repair guy 👍

[26/09/2019, 16:45:55] ‪+31 6 34269866‬: Hello guys, if anyone is looking for a butcher, the butchers on bethnal green rd has really good quality cuts which are usually cheaper than Sainsbury's. The guy that runs it is really nice and knows his meats  He was chatting to me today about how his business is struggling so I told him I'd recommend him to the house❤
[26/09/2019, 16:46:36] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: Good to know! Thanks
[26/09/2019, 16:48:37] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: Outsiders welcome too 😉
[26/09/2019, 16:50:07] ‪+44 7971 638784‬: Can we get an address? Sounds amazing!
[26/09/2019, 16:51:51] ‪+31 6 34269866‬: 374 bethnal green rd
[26/09/2019, 16:51:53] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Yes. Just Googled it.  Is it The Butcher Shop?  So important to support local businesses!
[26/09/2019, 16:52:00] ‪+31 6 34269866‬: It's called 'the butchers'
[26/09/2019, 16:52:15] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Yup. That’s it. Ta!
[26/09/2019, 17:08:55] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: Sweet. I'll be there.
[26/09/2019, 17:16:02] ‪+44 7751 240951‬: I'll take a butchers hook
[26/09/2019, 18:21:31] ‪+44 7729 627063‬: Does anyone know any Kenyan musicians by any chance?
[26/09/2019, 18:40:46] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Without wanting to embarrass anyone, & not naming names - we’ve had the first of our weekly kitchen inspections. I’ve seen a 1 star rating & noticed there is no 0 option. How many other ‘defo room for improvement’ scores out there?
[26/09/2019, 18:58:39] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: I do
[26/09/2019, 19:23:16] ‪+44 7483 211468‬: We got downrated for food stuff storage, or a squash and a pumpkin on the counter looking great! Apparently they look into the fridges too, I ain't playing no more 🙋
[26/09/2019, 19:30:11] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: The fridges took our kitchen by surprise too.
[26/09/2019, 19:31:11] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: Yeah we got marked down for fridges 😂
[26/09/2019, 19:31:13] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Kitchen users I mean. Our kitchen couldn’t care less!
[26/09/2019, 19:31:42] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: If you got a 1, sort it out 😂
[26/09/2019, 19:33:00] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Doesn’t bode well for halloween.
[26/09/2019, 19:50:06] ‪+44 7402 294991‬: Oh no! Does it mean I cannot eat my food anymore?
[26/09/2019, 19:53:50] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Depends. Do you have a webcam hooked up? Sounds kinky.
[26/09/2019, 20:29:30] ‪+44 7402 294991‬: 😳 a webcam looking at me not eating !?
Oh, of them deciding if I can eat? 🤡
[26/09/2019, 20:36:25] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Of course not. It’s the cleaning up & food storage Ke’oni is commenting on.
[26/09/2019, 20:40:37] ‪+44 7784 681354‬: In London? Ask Robert from security, he s Kenyan. If you just want the name of the bands o have 2 I really like

[26/09/2019, 21:03:18] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: But you’re such an overachiever & inspiration to us all! I did say to ddd it would be useful to guardians to understand when Serg collected the bins. That just means if there’s room I chuck in extra stuff on collection day rather than trolling down to the bins.
[26/09/2019, 21:04:33] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Other than that, first 5 I’ve seen/ it’s possible!
[26/09/2019, 21:09:24] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: I think Serge does kitchens on Friday?
[26/09/2019, 21:10:38] ‪+44 7483 211468‬: Bin overflowing and you got a 5 🤔🤔🤔🤔
[26/09/2019, 21:10:45] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Hey Simon, have you seen Heartbeat of Home @ Piccadilly Theatre? Combo of dancing including (mainly) Irish, Flamenco & Salsa. Really good. Cheapie-do tkts, ie. £2-4 were floating about.
[26/09/2019, 21:12:19] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: From my obvs, Serg does ours on 3 on Monday, Wednesday & Fridays. Pubic holidays mess up Monday & week.
[26/09/2019, 21:14:46] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Sorry, typo Public!
[26/09/2019, 21:15:05] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: FFS!
[26/09/2019, 21:17:10] ‪+44 7898 248880‬: We got 5, with comments re recommendation for the floor, but in our defense, we already knew and were going to do a deep clean next week and start a possible makeover.
[26/09/2019, 21:20:06] ‪+44 7784 681354‬: Oh no I didn't! Sounds amazing where I can get those? Thx for the tip
[26/09/2019, 21:22:05] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Another star! We (my kitchen) got a 4 & Ke’oni’s comments were valid. The whole point with being marked as a group is everyone now has to step up & do their bit.
[26/09/2019, 21:25:25] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: If I see them again I’ll chance it & grab a few to hand out. I know nothing about dance but was impressed. Michael Flatley put his name to it. They had 2x Salsa couples, different but extremely fab!
[26/09/2019, 21:40:27] ‪+44 7729 627063‬: Good shout! Yes please - names would good! I could try and get in contact

[26/09/2019, 21:47:46] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: & I’d seriously pay to see the show if no seat fillers/ cheapie-do tickets were available. Seen the show 2x now & standing ovations each time. For me, the dark skinned dancers/ not headliners were magic! If I could do that (just once by accident), I’d be telling everyone!
[26/09/2019, 22:19:20] ‪+44 7784 681354‬: If I could grab 2 tix from you that would be fab 👏
[26/09/2019, 22:20:41] ‪+44 7784 681354‬: But they are big and in Kenya don't think they ll come to booth house 🤷‍♂my favourite is Elani they are absolutely amazing. And the other one is Sauti Sol it s the most popular band in Kenya and around
[26/09/2019, 22:25:56] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Will give you first shout!
[26/09/2019, 22:27:24] ‪+44 7784 681354‬: Amazeballs!
[26/09/2019, 22:34:45] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: I usually see a shedload of shows & this was one of the good ones. Fishermen @ Trafalgar Studios/ Nigerian play. Amazing!
[26/09/2019, 22:36:58] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: That sold out at Arcola so I could never sit in
[26/09/2019, 22:40:19] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: It’s been around & it’s wonderful!
[26/09/2019, 22:41:22] Bryce Dotdotdot: *SMALL LAUNDRY*: It should go without saying, but please don’t steal the 50p’s from the dryer! It’s very annoying!
[26/09/2019, 22:42:31] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: I literally just used the 50p like an hour and half ago but in the washing machine
[26/09/2019, 22:43:43] Bryce Dotdotdot: 🤔

[26/09/2019, 22:44:24] ‪+44 7534 190697‬: It was there when I did my washing earlier. I hope I didn't take it away in a senior moment but I remember donating a 50p to the cause ages ago.
[26/09/2019, 22:45:07] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: I love these off the cuff/ small shows/ examples of new & fab. Fishermen is unexpectedly fab in anyone’s money!
[26/09/2019, 22:58:00] ‪+44 7534 190697‬: While I was stammering through my half hearted apology Mat let me off the hook. I was there earlier than him.

[26/09/2019, 23:01:39] ‪+44 7534 190697‬: The laundry.

[26/09/2019, 23:21:07] ‪+44 7534 190697‬: Well 50p was my first wage for a day and a half's work but they called it ten bob then. A very long time ago.
[26/09/2019, 23:23:13] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Mate... stop living in the past. It’s gone now...
[26/09/2019, 23:24:43] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Why don’t you think it’s happy?

[26/09/2019, 23:32:47] ‪+44 7483 211468‬: You down there now? Go outside and I'll throw one down to you

[28/09/2019, 17:20:45] ‪+44 7849 305177‬: They are a lot of fun. Tiring but without the pressure of being any good at dancing because a) it's fairly simple and b) most attendees have little clue what they're doing. Plus, often, kilts
[28/09/2019, 17:23:44] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Ohh - stop it! Sounds like great fun. Enjoy!
[28/09/2019, 18:40:09] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: It's not that I can't be bothered, it's that I keep my whatsapp threads fairly austere and there is nothing to scroll back to, so the only ID in my contacts list is a phone # without a name

[28/09/2019, 18:46:28] ‪+44 7796 624331‬: Can I just say ... the Fabulous & Fantastic Frankie created our meditation room. For anyone who hasn’t checked it out, it’s 3D5.

Good Morning Guardians,

I hope you are able to join me on Wednesday 2nd October from 6:30- 8:30 pm in the Ground Floor Lounge for the highly anticipaed Meet and Greet. There will be drinks and nibbles, and most importantly great conversation as I get to know those of you that can make it. 


I would also like to use this opportunity to open the floor to any clubs and committees that want to give a brief introduction about themselves and how to join.


I especiallly encourage new Guardians to attend, as it will be a chance to meet your fellow housemates and explore new ways to become involved in Booth House life.


Please reply to confirm if you are attending. I hope to see you there,


Ke'oni Cunningham

A new wood store needs to be found - possibly IT room which would have to be cleared out - this is not finalised.  Then order wood for framing to be delivered, build out.

We are beginning to plan for the next Booth Haus Art Fair & Exhibition, expected to run 30th November to 8th December. To build up steam towards this first Booth Haus Open Exhibition, we will have a planning meeting on Sunday 13th October. If you wish to contribute to this event – exhibitor, construction, curation, behind-the-scenes, on-the-day support, etc – please join us in the lounge at 19.00!

We will need quite a few volunteers (bookable with DDD as hours), for a wide variety of fun activities! We are pleased to say that the founder of DDD visited the 1st BHAF and was really impressed. It is with her direct support that we are building up the exhibition – open to public, more space, and with luck a catalogue available for purchase and dissemination into the local and wider community.

The agenda for the meeting is below. For those unable to join in person but interested in being part of the discussion we will set up a video link.

Agenda
13/10/2019: lounge

1.	Review and feedback on 1st art fair and exhibition (all)
2.	Objectives for BHAF#2
3.	Outline of plans for BHAF#2 (Mai/ Jooles)
4.	Sub groups to support & request for volunteers
a.	Curatorial (Mai)
b.	Build and infrastructure (Jooles + Pete as needed)
c.	Catalogue (Pete)
d.	Marketing (Jem…?)
e.	Project mgt and operations (Frankie)
5.	Next meeting(s)
6.	AOB

Intellectual Property Office rejected application, because it contained the word ‘queer’. According to the IPO, queer is ‘offensive’ and ‘contrary to accepted moral values within the UK’.

[07/10/2019, 11:01:49] ‪+44 7342 316282‬: I've got an email too and also already registered to vote. I'm guessing these letters sent will be addressed to the household rather than individual residents, hence none of us receiving one

[07/10/2019, 12:24:31] ‪+44 7870 830040‬: The system is unfortunately a joke and cannot compute our living arrangement. Apparently some people at BH received a letter and that counts for the whole house. Even though no one guardian can account for all those registered to vote. 

I called the council up about this a month ago and they said 'just wait and you'll receive the HEF form'. I lost my patience a bit because I don't like being threatened with losing my democratic right to vote and she 'no, no, that won't happen, you'll get the form through' and guess what - still no form received. Anyone who's concerned about this should call up, but be warned, I was on hold for 25 minutes last time.
[07/10/2019, 12:36:54] ‪+34 636 41 54 16‬: Really? but in theory DDD pays for all of our councils isn't it? At least that's what they told me when I've signed up. If we all count as residents then I'm not sure about what's the issue but yeah thanks Rhian for letting us know.
[07/10/2019, 12:38:09] ‪+44 7870 830040‬: Being a resident doesn't automatically register you on the electoral register. You have to register online or via a postal form.
[07/10/2019, 12:39:14] ‪+44 7870 830040‬: I don't have our guardianship contact to hand, but I'll be amazed if DDD register us on our behalf.
[07/10/2019, 12:40:01] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: DDD pay Council tax.  I think the form they're talking about treated to the electoral roll.  "The form warns you can be fined £1000 for failing to respond.... You could also ultimately be booted off the electoral register if you don't respond."
[07/10/2019, 12:40:29] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Relates.  Not treated.
[07/10/2019, 12:41:16] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: If we could only link them up with the bastards who post re tv license.  They manage to mail each unit.
[07/10/2019, 12:43:43] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: This sound amazing. I'm game, I've got a visitor from Newcastle, she might not be
[07/10/2019, 12:47:29] Bryce Dotdotdot: One HEF form is sent to “The Occupier” at the Booth House address, listing everyone who has registered. The problem is that DDD have presumably not opened or not responded to that letter.
[07/10/2019, 12:48:56] Bryce Dotdotdot: When you register online it has individual addresses for each flat, but Tower Hamlets change then to just be the generic Booth House address
[07/10/2019, 12:53:08] ‪+44 7870 830040‬: When I spoke to the council, they said they had 'received some responses' from our address. Suggesting more than one form has been sent.

Has anyone completed this form for themselves?
[07/10/2019, 12:56:38] ‪+44 7961 427361‬: I’m registered but I haven’t received a form
[07/10/2019, 12:58:08] Bryce Dotdotdot: There aren’t (shouldn’t be) individual forms. Just one for “The Occupier” at Booth House which DDD needs to respond to.

[10/10/2019, 10:10:46] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Yes that's the same as me, Jooles.  The app is Babylon, the NHS service is GP at Hand (the app can also be used for private health care).  The nearest physical clinics are around Canary Wharf and near Kings Cross for blood tests, poking and prodding.  You can often get appointments quickly, certainly conveniently, they have always been within a couple of minutes of "on time", you can have phone or video chat, you can be referred to specialists, get prescriptions, etc.  I've had a different doctor each time and they haven't read my file, so that is absolutely no different from going into my previous clinic.  Plus you can talk to a doctor even if you're out of town.  It takes about 24 hours to get on their roster.
[10/10/2019, 12:06:40] Jen Dotdotdot: I love using Babylon!! if your ailment is something that you've had before and easy to diagnose over the phone they can even send a prescription to a local pharmacist. I've had antibiotics within half an hour of booking a chat on Babylon before!

[10/10/2019, 16:46:08] ‪+44 7898 248880‬: Dear Booth House guardians,

We would like to remind all guardians at Booth House of our drugs policy. We have recently come across a few separate incidents of illegal drug use in the building. Whilst each incident is dealt with individually, it's important for us to communicate what our drug policy is more widely. 

There is a zero tolerance on illegal drug use in Booth House and anyone found to be storing, possessing or taking drugs in the building puts their housing with Dot Dot Dot at risk. 

Smoking of any kind inside the building is also against our rules, our fire regulations and our agreement with the building’s owners. It also risks setting off the building’s sensitive fire alarm system, causing great nuisance to all 90 guardians.

The building’s owners, SAHA, regularly visit the building. If they were to discover any use of illegal drugs in the building this could cause detrimental damage to our relationship with our client and put the whole project at risk. This could potentially cause every resident to receive 28 days notice to hand back Booth House and cause Dot Dot Dot substantial reputational damage. 

Drugs are illegal inside Booth House just as they are outside of it. Dot Dot Dot have been working hard with other organisations to tackle the anti-social behaviour and obvious drug use outside the building. We know many of you have huge concerns about the anti-social behaviour and therefore it is very important we do everything we can to discourage this behaviour. Drug use inside Booth House goes directly against our positive work of tackling anti-social behaviour outside the building.

Thank you very much for your understanding on this matter and if you need any further clarification please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

Dot Dot Dot

[17/10/2019, 15:30:25] ‪+44 7960 036447‬: Is anyone still eating carbs? 
Emilia's Crafted Pasta (77 Alie Street, London, E1 8NH) is giving away free pasta on Friday 25th October between 12 - 4pm and 5.30 - 9.30pm. One plate per person. No booking. Just turn up. It’s a new place which is why it wants exposure but the pasta is all handmade and looks awesome.
[17/10/2019, 15:50:00] ‪+31 6 34269866‬: Emilias has got a couple locations in london,can confirm that the food in the other locations is very nice

[17/10/2019, 18:56:56] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: I've not seen it for years. Amazing film and the score is immense.
[17/10/2019, 19:02:35] ‪+44 7821 589550‬: Just wanted to clarify - are we expected to pay another license fee on top of what we already paid or are they just changing the terminology?
[17/10/2019, 19:05:18] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: Nah, just changing the terms to fit the new law.
[17/10/2019, 19:09:18] ‪+44 7961 427361‬: According to my letter I’ll have to top mine up by £81
[17/10/2019, 19:11:30] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: That's a bit steep
[17/10/2019, 19:11:33] Jooles Dotdotdot: I would get them to double check that. It’s an increase of 3%
[17/10/2019, 19:11:34] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: I thought we were getting a refund ?
[17/10/2019, 19:12:05] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: Ohh sorry I get it now
[17/10/2019, 19:15:57] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Your deposit, not your monthly, right?
[17/10/2019, 19:16:05] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: That's the rent increase. The deposit fee law has been changed as well. I have to top up mines not by nearly that much like.
[17/10/2019, 19:18:42] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: I'm not sure how they calculated the deposit when we moved in but it looks like it's just going from 5 weeks at the old rate to 5 weeks at the new rate.
[17/10/2019, 19:20:56] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Unless your deposit was low to begin with, it should be approx £28.  Unless my maths are way off.
[17/10/2019, 19:36:18] ‪+44 7779 106535‬: Hah! They want £144 from me!
[17/10/2019, 19:37:28] ‪+44 7483 211468‬: I'm getting a cashback!
[17/10/2019, 19:37:56] ‪+44 7961 427361‬: Yes the deposit - my monthly rent is going up by £20 pm
[17/10/2019, 19:38:13] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: That sounds right
[17/10/2019, 19:39:03] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Annexers, were your deposits not £937-938 to begin with?
[17/10/2019, 19:39:56] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Surely that means you were screwed when you moved in...?
[17/10/2019, 19:40:14] ‪+44 7961 427361‬: Can’t remember and I’m not home so can’t check the paperwork x
[17/10/2019, 19:41:42] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: I'm just figuring, my deposit was about 5 weeks of the current monthly, and my deposit increase is 125% of the monthly increase.  I tried to do that with what I guessed your costs to be.
[17/10/2019, 19:43:45] ‪+44 7342 316282‬: Sad to miss this, love the film and especially the soundtrack
[17/10/2019, 19:47:36] ‪+44 7961 427361‬: That’s steep Aslan!
[17/10/2019, 19:57:35] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Is that because of your studio?
[17/10/2019, 19:58:22] ‪+44 7727 173252‬: My rent is going up by £70 a month - is it the same for others?
[17/10/2019, 19:59:54] ‪+44 7779 106535‬: @447961427361 @447717345724 it is a bit steep but I checked the original deposit and it’s right. Ugh.
[17/10/2019, 20:00:43] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Ooooh no
[17/10/2019, 20:01:07] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: At least that's the bit you should get back, as opposed to the license fee.
[17/10/2019, 20:02:38] ‪+44 7961 427361‬: Wow!
[17/10/2019, 20:03:09] ‪+44 7727 173252‬: That’s a 13% increase and I just moved in. I’m not happy at all
[17/10/2019, 20:03:35] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: That can't be right, should be a 3% increase!
[17/10/2019, 20:03:45] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: This all seems v confusing
[17/10/2019, 20:03:51] ‪+44 7727 173252‬: Maybe it’s a mistake?? God I hope so
[17/10/2019, 20:03:53] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: I’m getting £300 back
[17/10/2019, 20:04:19] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: Louise is here tomorrow from 2pm
[17/10/2019, 20:05:43] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Doing this 90 times over, there's bound to be mistakes.  That said, there are only 4 different license fees.  There should only be 4 different permutations.  Except maybe Aslan 😉
[17/10/2019, 20:05:56] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Does it make sense to you?
[17/10/2019, 20:10:03] ‪+44 7751 240951‬: I believe the email said 3% was the average increase and they were looking to establish a clear fee for each unit, so whilst some would increase substantially, others may decrease, with the deposit being brought in line to be 5 weeks. The storage rooms were another matter due to the additional admin...
[17/10/2019, 20:11:20] ‪+44 7961 427361‬: What!! Did they say why?
[17/10/2019, 20:11:31] ‪+44 7483 211468‬: I'm always getting screwed one way or another.......but I make it a 3some 😲

[17/10/2019, 20:35:43] Dotdotdot: I'm paying 15 more a month and getting a £98 refund. Was we supposed to haggle our deposit?
[17/10/2019, 20:36:56] Dotdotdot: Or a social experiment on fee compliance

[17/10/2019, 21:49:38] ‪+44 7898 248880‬: How much did you initially pay?
[17/10/2019, 21:53:07] ‪+44 7342 316282‬: I'm a bit confused about this too, the amounts in the email don't make sense to me either
[17/10/2019, 22:05:25] ‪+420 737 501 024‬: I will be paying just £18 more and I will get £66 cashback. I think my deposit was for 6 weeks if I remember correctly
[17/10/2019, 22:24:21] Bryce Dotdotdot: Sounds like a mistake unless you are somehow paying less than others with the same room type.
[17/10/2019, 22:24:35] Bryce Dotdotdot: But either way 13% isn’t right
[17/10/2019, 22:25:47] Bryce Dotdotdot: Mine went up by £15 which is slightly less than 3%. I originally paid a £750 deposit and they want £17 more to take it up to 5 weeks, which is correct
[17/10/2019, 22:26:18] ‪+44 7727 173252‬: I think I figured it out - I’m due to start paying extra for a storage room in November for the first time, which they’ve factored into my new price, which is why it looked like such a big leap.
[17/10/2019, 22:26:45] Bryce Dotdotdot: That makes sense
[17/10/2019, 22:27:55] Bryce Dotdotdot: But how much are you getting from Three after last nights debacle? You could be rich!

[19/10/2019, 13:38:16] Jen Dotdotdot: I heard a few people talking about making it into a sewing and crafts room?
[19/10/2019, 13:40:06] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: You aren't wrong.  I wanted to check how inconvenient that would be for current users and if there was a better arrangement.
[19/10/2019, 13:58:50] ‪+44 7960 036447‬: No furniture in movement studio please- IT is ideal for crafts

[19/10/2019, 14:04:23] ‪+44 7960 036447‬: The 2D space is empty on purpose and needs to stay that way.

Dear Boothers,

The Art Exhibition is for everybody. You do not have to consider yourself as an artist. But I promise you, you will feel like one after you participate. If you have created something which you could exhibit or sell, including literature, performing and other forms of art, please come to the meeting at 7pm today. 

The art world can be pretentious but that’s not us. We will not let you down but will lift you and your creations up. All we ask in return is commitment. Late comers won’t be able to participate this time round, so if you are interested and cannot attend today please contact me as there will be an alternative date for others who couldn’t attend.

Love,

Frankie
Project Manager 👩🏻‍💼

[20/10/2019, 09:31:52] ‪+44 7534 190697‬: I'd like to have a go but I'm volunteering tonight and I'm not sure I'll be here for the event. When is it again?
[20/10/2019, 09:32:52] Jooles Dotdotdot: Weekends of 30th Nov and 7th of Dec
[20/10/2019, 09:43:51] ‪+44 7787 767093‬: Quick question: what’s the vacuum situation?
[20/10/2019, 09:47:15] ‪+44 7545 501816‬: There should be 2 yellow hoovers downstairs in the Boothermarket. Its the little room in the right closest corner when you come out of the lift
[20/10/2019, 09:49:51] Bryce Dotdotdot: And the most important Booth House rule of all... always return the hoovers!

This art exhibition is held and organised by the Booth Haus Artist’s Network. The network was set up to encourage each other to meet, socialise and share knowledge and skills. We’ll be looking to hold workshops and classes on various subjects in the future. We regularly meet up once a fortnight to talk about all things creative. 

The up and coming exhibition is for members of the network so if you want to exhibit it’s expected for you to join the group and attend the fortnightly socials and also dedicate some time to the help organise the exhibition over the next 6 weeks. All hands on deck. This is a joint venture. Let’s all work together to make this happen 😊

[20/10/2019, 10:30:33] ‪+44 7482 729729‬: arghhh this is so crap I’ve just realised I’m not in the country 1st - 7th nov
[20/10/2019, 10:30:57] ‪+44 7482 729729‬: will make something XR related for display but won’t be around to help 😞 sorry sorry x
[20/10/2019, 11:33:11] ‪+34 677 75 61 11‬: We got locked out from our room, what do we do? We also know they don’t have a spare copy for our room
[20/10/2019, 11:34:29] ‪+34 677 75 61 11‬: Basically we need someone to use the master key for our room
[20/10/2019, 11:35:55] ‪+44 7821 589550‬: @447794683247 your poor friends who I kicked out half asleep and drunk 🤭😬

But also - I did say I’d be working down there today it’s been booked and everything and when I arrived with my client there’s people sleeping and broken glass and booze. Not impressed really I know Bam’s gone but it’s still our photo studio can you have some respect for shared spaces please and check what’s going on before you trash the place. Not just you Oscar, everyone involved. 
Well also find a way that you can check other than on this group what’s happening down there before you let a party happen!
[20/10/2019, 11:40:02] ‪+34 677 75 61 11‬: Pete is on his way 😆
[20/10/2019, 11:45:07] Jooles Dotdotdot: This could have been sent privately
[20/10/2019, 11:58:08] ‪+44 7733 107661‬: 3B3 guardian - sorry i can’t figure out who you are 🙆🏻‍♂. According to DDD your cooker needs disconnecting ready for disposal, and i am the lucky DDD appointed technician to do this for you 🤣🤣🤣. Pls can you contact me to arrange a good time? Thx.
[20/10/2019, 12:15:53] ‪+44 7821 589550‬: This applies to everyone not just one person. I named Oscar cuz it was his friends but we can all be more aware in shared spaces so it’s fine to send it in this group.
[20/10/2019, 12:27:47] Jen Dotdotdot: Sounds like a one off though, if it was happening constantly then it's a house issue but a one off mistake by one person is more respectful addressed privately
[20/10/2019, 12:32:01] ‪+44 7821 589550‬: Well it’s more respectful to not leave broken glass litter and drunk friends asleep in communal/work areas. Not fair on guests not fair on people living and working here, respectfully...
[20/10/2019, 12:45:11] ‪+44 7482 729729‬: who’s got da hoover

[20/10/2019, 20:29:08] ‪+44 7821 589550‬: Anyone have their car/van here could you PM me please?
[20/10/2019, 21:20:14] Bryce Dotdotdot: I don’t blame them, the gas bill must have been astronomical last year. With all the valves opened up and heating empty rooms on full blast all the time...
[20/10/2019, 21:26:20] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: Did they shut the radiators off in empty rooms? I might ask tomorrow.

Hey guys, I'm just on my way to Heathrow to enter a new chapter of my life far from the clutches of Brexit.

I'd just like to say that it's been a pleasure knowing you all and I want to personally thank you all for being a part of the last 14 months of my life, which may have been the best.

I wish you all well, and hope to cross paths with many of you again.

If you ever find yourself in a land down under, give me a shout. I'll happily provide shelter and exceptional hospitality.

Take care everyone.

DON'T TOUCH THE ELECTRICALS!!!!!

Even if you know what you're doing, the building is possessed.

Okay, he didn't say "possessed".  I see Frankie has just suggested "topsy turvy".  Which seems precise enough for our purposes.

[25/10/2019, 10:58:52] ‪+44 7960 036447‬: Thanks for the link! Could you please repost Pete’s post for new members?
[25/10/2019, 11:20:43] ‪+44 7898 248880‬: Dear Booth House guardians,


We first raised a works order for the heating to be switched on on the 9th October. I have escalated the lack of heating at Booth House and have been assured an engineer will attend next Tuesday 29th to get the heating working. 


I am sorry this is taking longer than expected to sort out and I know many of you have been cold. We have a limited amount of heaters left to hand out. If you do need one for the time being please ask at reception. These will be handed out on a first come, first served basis until they're gone. We would like these heaters back once Booth House becomes warm and toasty again.


Thank you for your continued patience with this.


Kind Regards,


Louise

I frankly don't think the situation is good enough, but I doubt screaming will improve things.  It's Friday.  I've looked at the weather forecast.  Tonight and tomorrow are not too bad but Sunday night will be similar to last night, close to freezing.  I've got either a space heater or a small heating pad (the kind you put on a strained muscle, not a bed-sized hot blanket) I can share and extra duvets and blankets.  

If you're suffering in your rooms, let me know.  If you have heat to spare, shout out.

[25/10/2019, 11:45:21] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: That's something of a mixed message, Chris.  Are you trying to entice people into your room or warning them off?

I need to actually work out what our legal rights are as guardians as I have a sneaky feeling that DDD is responsible for ensuring that we allllllllllll have adequate heating not this “first come first serve” bullshit. Anyone up for being an amateur solicitor?

[25/10/2019, 17:15:41] ‪+44 7960 036447‬: It’s wrestling with theatrics and i mean raunch in its colloquial sense without knowing for sure if it will adequately describe the experience.

Afternoon all 👋🏻 

A few of us in the house are going to put on a roast tomorrow afternoon. Everyone in the house is welcome. The more the merrier. We really want to bring the community together again. Positive vibes and all that. It’s something we want to start doing every Sunday. We’ll be catering for Vegans and Carnivores. 

There’s a list on the front door. Please put your name against a dish that we need or put your name down if you’re coming so we know numbers. Would be great to see you all there. 

3PM in the canteen 👨🏼‍🍳👩🏻‍🍳
Any questions, Please DM me or Frankie.

[26/10/2019, 13:20:43] Jen Dotdotdot: List is on the front door for people!! Sign up, especially new people come join 🌞🌞🌞
[26/10/2019, 14:42:19] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: Hey all. The clothes rail from the Boother market has been taken. Can it be returned please.
[26/10/2019, 15:02:08] ‪+44 7874 298536‬: Hey Millie, if you don't have a plan for the insides of the pumpkin - there's a 👌cake recipe - so give me a shout 🎃 🍰
[26/10/2019, 15:06:26] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: Of anyone's doing a white wash in the next couple of days can I put a shirt in please? Need it for an interview but don't wanna do a full wash for 1 shirt.
[26/10/2019, 15:09:22] ‪+420 737 501 024‬: I wanna do my bedsheets on Tue or Wed. Because my friend Karolina will arrive on Thursday. But you might find someone washing whites earlier
[26/10/2019, 15:29:42] ‪+44 7849 305177‬: Looks like Master Chief of The Opera
[26/10/2019, 15:30:31] ‪+44 7342 316282‬: Ah nice! I was thinking about making some pumpkin muffins but I don't think I will have time so I'll save the insides for you
[26/10/2019, 16:08:31] ‪+420 737 501 024‬: Where about in basement? I tried to find you
[26/10/2019, 16:15:56] ‪+44 7483 211468‬: Where da peeps?
[26/10/2019, 16:20:25] ‪+44 7342 316282‬: We're postponing for a couple of hours
[26/10/2019, 16:47:15] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: I saw a clothes rail in the event in the canteen earlier.
[26/10/2019, 16:48:33] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: I spoke to the organizer who said they would return the rails and rehang the clothes.
[26/10/2019, 16:49:08] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Do we know what the event was or who was responsible for it?
[26/10/2019, 16:53:16] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: It's all good.
[26/10/2019, 16:57:22] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: That does not answer my question, but thank you for your opinion
[26/10/2019, 17:12:40] ‪+44 7929 995597‬: It's a Hillsong thing. I felt a certain way letting all these women in because I had no idea if they were lying or not. Difficult to stop 20 women entering the building when you've opened the door.
‎[26/10/2019, 17:13:37] ‪+44 7483 211468‬: ‎image omitted
[26/10/2019, 17:13:58] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: Is pumpkin carving now?
[26/10/2019, 17:22:29] ‪+44 7342 316282‬: Nice! 🎃🧡
[26/10/2019, 17:23:43] ‪+44 7342 316282‬: I've got the tools if you have a pumpkin? I'll be doing mine at 6, still have to go buy some
[26/10/2019, 17:29:54] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Hey, I LOVE that the space is getting used like this, but did I miss the memo it was happening?  @447399305613?  Because sometimes even *I* can't keep up with the messages.
[26/10/2019, 17:38:56] ‪+44 7960 036447‬: I missed this memo. What was the memo? What is Hillsong? Where is the remedial class?
[26/10/2019, 17:39:42] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: I missed memo also.
[26/10/2019, 18:04:07] ‪+44 7960 036447‬: Anyone wanna repost for kids in the back?
[26/10/2019, 18:06:22] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Okay I'm willing to believe there wasn't a memo, not that I just didn't read it.
[26/10/2019, 18:06:32] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: In case there was no memo
[26/10/2019, 18:07:27] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Could we please shoot out a message when we are using communal spaces for events, because DDD aren't going to do it?
[26/10/2019, 18:08:34] ‪+44 7929 995597‬: One of the ladies mentioned it was a paid for space so I assume it's definitely DDDs responsibility to let us know
[26/10/2019, 18:10:39] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: I think a Guardian helped organise so there was probably a misunderstanding about who would pass on word to the residents.
[26/10/2019, 18:11:41] ‪+44 7929 995597‬: I think it should always be assumed it's your responsibility to get the word out
[26/10/2019, 18:14:10] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: That's safest
[26/10/2019, 18:22:57] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: The woman promised that the rails would be replaced and all the clothes would be rehung as they were.
They obviously were not.
The upside is that sharon and I get an extra hour or two of volunteering restoring the Boother Market to its  original condition
[26/10/2019, 18:24:22] ‪+44 7799 777387‬: OK. Well, this certainly needs to be raised.

Thank you @447870497809 And Sharon
[26/10/2019, 18:58:22] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: I had a chat with Heather and Rachel who were connected to the event and were very nice and forthcoming and conscientious.
They were in the process of organizing the Market back to the state they had found it.
At some point before they had arrived apparently someone had shifted the rails and shoved the Hoovers around and clothes were added to the pile.
So no fault on the part of the seminar.
[26/10/2019, 18:59:54] ‪+44 7821 589550‬: If it’s still going I’d love this!
[26/10/2019, 19:18:13] Jen Dotdotdot: Is anyone going to the shops?
[26/10/2019, 19:49:58] ‪+420 737 501 024‬: Black Chalk walls at the basement ready for art 👩‍🎨👨‍🎨

[26/10/2019, 19:51:53] ‪+44 7784 681354‬: Guys just a reminder. If you intend to use the canteen please put the info of the event in the booking doc. Thanks!

[26/10/2019, 21:03:50] ‪+44 7929 995597‬: Has anyonw seen a white light box? I last saw it Boothday and in the louge on the bookcase left to the projector screen bur i cant find it therw anymore
[26/10/2019, 21:04:08] ‪+44 7849 305177‬: Anyone have any fake eyelash glue (or whatever it's actually called)?
[26/10/2019, 21:49:05] ‪+44 7807 072931‬: Anyone got hairspray?

[28/10/2019, 10:11:47] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Apparently that's why the remaining lift is out of service

[28/10/2019, 10:11:55] ‪+44 7733 107661‬: No it isnt

[28/10/2019, 10:12:30] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Anyway he's complaining that the fire cupboards in all the kitchens save floor 1 are blocked.

[28/10/2019, 10:13:01] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: He says if rescue needs access they won't carefully move things, they'll chuck out of the way.
[28/10/2019, 10:13:05] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Yes
[28/10/2019, 10:13:45] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: He's going to talk to Louise later so expect to get word the kitchens need to be reorganised to provide 24/7 access.
[28/10/2019, 10:14:32] ‪+44 7738 864742‬: He was lovely to me. I made him a latte.
[28/10/2019, 10:15:04] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: You are a nicer person than I am.  I think we all knew that.
[28/10/2019, 10:16:17] ‪+44 7738 864742‬: It’s just a facade my dear. I’m really a mad axe murderer. But I like to think I’m polite to my victims. 
I think your super duper nice zo ☺
[28/10/2019, 10:19:01] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: What really matters is what people think of you.  Not who you are deep down.  Right?
[28/10/2019, 10:25:17] ‪+44 7738 864742‬: Most philosophical conclusion I’ve ever heard in my entire life. I shall now be extremely careful regarding how strangers construct their perceptions of me. NOT!! (Maniacal laughter for disturbing effect)

[28/10/2019, 11:10:48] Bryce Dotdotdot: Hmm, could a better place be found, closer to the lifts? Basement? The lounge adds a lot of extra hassle and we already have problems with them not being returned
[28/10/2019, 11:11:35] Bryce Dotdotdot: Also, I would argue that having the hoovers in Boothmarket brings more “customers” to the Boothmarket! Retail is all about footfall.

[28/10/2019, 11:48:57] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: Hi  Bryce,
We're more than open to places to put the hoovers.
But people often just dump them and block the door and floor space. And this weekend, somebody left the room in complete chaos moving rails around to leave Hoovers against the wall.
It's actually easier to take them out of the cupboard than out of the Boother Market.
But whatever is the most convenient alternative to all is fine.
[28/10/2019, 11:49:34] ‪+44 7733 107661‬: It would seem more toilet rolls have been taken from Sergie’s storage in basement. He is on the warpath and we may well end up in same situation as previously with DDD all over cards again. 

I asked him to give me some time to resolve with DDD getting involved.  

If it is you FFS please contact me and let’s discuss. This time around there could be serious consequences.

How it works:
🥦 If you would like to attend this coming Sunday, join/rejoin the group chat. 
🥔 Put your name next to a dish in the group description (if you can’t cook this time round, you’re still welcome to join us)
🥩 The roast veggies and meat is just the foundation, please feel free to bring any dish. Please state any dietary requirements. We currently cater to vegan and gluten-free.
🍰 After the meal we will be watching a film together in the lounge.
🍷 Everyone then gets kicked out of the group chat and only rejoins when they can attend again (this helps us know how many people we are cooking for)

A family that eats together, stays together.
                  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Anyone here who knows someone that works for Foxtons or other estate agents?
Asking for Ewa 🙂
[31/10/2019, 10:40:46] ‪+44 7870 497809‬: Fenya,
The real estate market in the UK is very screwy.
Estate agents only deal with specific properties in a very limited geographic area. Foxtons tried to impose their system on high end properties in Manhattan, and it was a well-known catastrophic failure
 Is Ewa looking to buy, sell, rent or other?
Amazingly enough,  the guy responsible for the New York debacle still has his job at Foxtons, and I know an agent who works for him.
Ps. Have you ever been to Naxos? 🌝

[02/11/2019, 13:50:16] Jen Dotdotdot: Hey angels 💕

We are having an artist's meetup tomorrow evening from 7pm!

I have a little task for people. 

Please can you bring some kind of art tool, such as a pen, a brush with paint, a Stanley knife, a crayon, whatever you feel like. 

We are going to do an activity to get everyone connecting as creatives and working together.

Everyone is welcome!

Even if you don't feel particularly artistic, I promise you'll surprise yourself. 

Join the artists group if you're coming 🌄

[04/11/2019, 09:33:05] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: Dungeons and Dragons is the original tabletop role playing game.  Think of it like a choose your own adventure crossed with improv.  You create a character from Tolkienesque species (i.e. I'm dragonborn, Anya's half-Orc, you can also be human) with certain skills.  You can create a whole backstory and personality which determine how you behave in the adventure.  The Dungeon Master is basically the storyteller, explaining where you are, what you see, and the results of your actions.  You use dice to determine if you're successful or unsuccessful in your choices.

Was referred to a specialist, that worked the same as when I was with a bricks and mortar GP.

A man once emailed his neighbour, "I really want to apologise deeply. Whenever you were out of town, I would take advantage of your wife. Never have I been so wonderfully serviced and for such long periods of time."

The neighbour went next door, and as soon as the man answered, the neighbour promptly shot him.

The neighbour stalked back home and continued reading his email. The next one was from the man and read, "Damn predictive text. I meant 'wifi'."

 *  Roast dinner at 2pm this Sunday*
              Please join the group 
 and add your name in the description.
         No money options available 
                - Everyone welcome

This week is with a twist...
A roast is an English tradition, but with such a diverse mix of housemates we would like to introduce alternative dishes. This week allow the roasted meat and veggies be the baseline and then let’s see what else gets added.

Coming soon... every other Sunday will become a different cuisine. If you would like to head up a particular cuisine please get in touch and let’s make it happen.

[07/11/2019, 18:33:51] ‪+44 7717 345724‬: PLAN AHEAD SUNDAY

So you already know about the Boothfamily dinner at 2.

This will be followed by Canteen Crafting.  Bring something you're working on for the art fair, something you've been putting off, something you're not sure how to do, or brainstorm with your corridormates on how you're going to decorate.  Or just hang out.

Then at 7 it's SUPERHERO SUNDAY in the lounge.  I think we're on Age of Ultron but it's anybody's guess.
