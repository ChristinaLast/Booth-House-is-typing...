 Congrats to all the uncles
 Does anyone know ladywell
 Yep
 Best way to get there
 Overground to Brockley then walk
 Cheers matey
 Do you want to go to the hospital Chris
 I do indeed
 Ladywell Station is at the back of the hospital across the park or there are buses from both Be Crosses and Lewisham stations I think there might even be busses from Brockley but its a bit of a hike otherwise
 Not be crosses New Crosses
 Cheers mate
 Also da south train from London Bridge plat 78
 If you want to walkmove as little as possible I suggest Overground to Shadwell DLR to Lewisham then bus to the hospital Maximum 500m walking in total
 Cheers
02092019 162737 Bryce Dotdotdot Overground Whitechapel to New Cross then Southeastern New Cross to Ladywell
 The walks pretty nice though Hilly fields is a great park
 Cheers Made it
 But what route did you take
02092019 163432 Jooles Dotdotdot Guys IåäÌİå»ve lost something big and black in the laundry room

 Nice one  Is this the same both ends too
 To whoever put my clothes in the dryer and turned it on I appreciate the thought but please dont do that That was a cycle of washing containing all the things that were too delicate to go into the dryer Half of it has shrunk Please just put it on top of one of the machines or in one of the baskets if you need the washer
 We should put a signs on the dryers to remind people IåäÌİå»m terrified someone will put some of my clothes in the dryer x

 GUARDIAN REPORT
NAME FAHAD TAHIR
DATE 050919 830 am
OUTSIDE ORGANISATION MK FIRE LTD ON BEHALF OF SALVATION ARMY
SERVICE AGREEMENT 072057509
REPRESENTIVE GRANT BAID
DETAILS
Grant arrived at around 830 where he presented documentation to Jem as she left the building After being let in Fahad accompanied him in his inspection around the building as they checked each kitchen for fire blankets and extinguishers 
GRANTåäÌİå»S CONCERNS
It was worrying to myself to hear about the concerns raised by Grant as we walked through the building Considering the door stop ban it is extremely worrying that a professional voiced his doubts about the building Suggesting that while the coverage is legal it may not be effective
åäÌİå¢
åäÌİå¢
åäÌİå¢
With respect to the last point it seems illogical for DDD to have removed the extinguishers from the corridors only to leave them in the kitchens Should DD have removed them due to untrained guardians being the obvious user why would the extinguishers remain in kitchens
Grant will be voicing his concerns to Louise later on today
GUARDIAN ACTIONS
åäÌİå¢
After liaising with a college of his Grant confirmed to myself that as each escape has an extinguisher DDD are compliant with fire regulation However in his professional opinion the corridors are too long for the extinguishers to provide any real coverage The above action appears to be the only way that guardians can find out who is liable should the worst occur
CLOSING COMMENTS
Considering the recent fire issues in London and the fact that our building is respectively old I believe that this is a cause for concern for Guardians I would like to note however that Grant was extremely impressed with the time and dedication that has been invested in the building and the level of trust exhibited between guardians as he cited that many people leave their rooms unlocked He was also very impressed by the art exhibition and would like to pass on his appreciation
05092019 094603 Jen Dotdotdot thank you so much Fahad
05092019 094617 Jen Dotdotdot Yes it always confused me so much when they took the fire extinguishers away
 I will drop louise a note to let her know that I have accompanied Grant on his inspection
 Cheers man
 Do we have a google drive for documentation
 447971638784 thanks for detailed report ÌªÌÓå
05092019 095426 Jooles Dotdotdot Did he mention anything about the exhibition being an increased fire risk DDD seem to think it is ÌªÌÒ
 yes but there is a way of putting out a fire so it is ok
 Awesome 447971638784  Thank you

05092019 115351 Dotdotdot Spontaneously combusting art kills millions Every 60 seconds a minute passes And we all need to run through that room before exiting the building
 Whaaat
 Doeesss anyone have a vanvehicle that would fit a double mattress in it to move Will pay for time and trouble ÌªÌá
05092019 135737 Bryce Dotdotdot Fire extinguishers in hallways unsafe because of the blocking issue In a smoke filled zerovisibility evacuation any clutter is a hazard Obviously would be nice to have them but theyåäÌİå»d need to be attached to walls or in recessed spaces And also not be used to prop open fire doors ÌªÌáÌ¢
05092019 140213 Dotdotdot Do the fire extinguishers really matter for the hallways Or are we just bored
05092019 140318 Dotdotdot PS thereåäÌİå»s no fire extinguisher in my shower ÌªÌâ
 IåäÌİå»ve used Addison LeeåäÌİå»s courier service before They have vans You can get a quote on their site

 I asked and they said they were checking for the closer and in general the quality of the fire proof Ness of the doors do they close well do they have the fire sealing in good condition etc
 Which DDD checked about 3 months ago and noted all missinginsufficient intumescent strips
05092019 155528 Dotdotdot Boxes need to be ticked
 They for some reason always overlooked my doors Which were withour closer since I moved in January My life with open doors is ruined ÌªÌá

19092019 163620 Tom Dotdotdot Happy Birthday Glenn
 Glenny Have a great birthday my dude
 How many birthdays do I get
 More than the Queen
 IåäÌİå»ve had a few over the years
 This would be my third this year apparently A distinct lack of cake
 So on what day would you normally expect cake
 ÌªÌáÌ¢ÌªÌáÌ¢ÌªÌáÌ¢
 On his every Bday guys now you need to make one Innit 447849305177
 I suppose then the onus is on the person wishing Glenn a happy birthday to provide the cake because otherwise its difficult to predict
 I support this

19092019 191038 Dotdotdot And so ends the birthday wish era on the group chat ÌªÌáÌ¢
19092019 191039 Dotdotdot What happened
19092019 192744 Bryce Dotdotdot All I saw was a lot of broken glass and Jooles cleaning it up Anything else would be speculation
 åäÌİvideo omitted
 Jooles was trying to move a glass table he caught a glimpse of his own reflection and didnt like what hed seenlost his temper 
 As odd as it sounds pressing fresh soft white bread slices onto the floor will pick up tiny shards of glass
 Should all be clean but Id err on the side of caution and wear shoes around the first floor landing at least

 Ive heard of these guys before when I organised a volunteers fair for my old work they came along
 One of the oldest and largest Housing Associations
24092019 011824 Jen Dotdotdot Is it just me or anyone else finding our friends out front absolutely unbearable recently
24092019 011828 Bryce Dotdotdot Would it be so hard for Victoria Court residents to close their windows when they have loud overnight parties Grr
24092019 011838 Jen Dotdotdot Seems to be every night
24092019 011850 Bryce Dotdotdot Yes back side is noisy tonight too
24092019 011857 Jen Dotdotdot Ughhhhhhh
 Ive had my earphones un but just took them out and it sounded like a girl screaming They seem to be getting louder again
 Hi guys IåäÌİå»m going to send an email to the overlords to try and get something done about these incessant nightly shrieking sessions If you have time please could you do the same to put some pressure on them xx
24092019 083552 Dotdotdot Related note Have I just tuned out the street side crackamonic orchestra or have they been very quiet not there anymore Has something been done
 No theyve been louder than usual
24092019 083735 Dotdotdot ÌªÌÁåäÌİååäå»Ì¢ heavy sleeper these days I guess

 They are also now on our main entrance doorstep late night
 With great power comes great responsibility
24092019 085315 Jen Dotdotdot i havent slept properly in like a week I swear Im going to start screaming like that soon
 You get the brunt of it as they are literally in your windows ÌªÌâ
24092019 085558 Jen Dotdotdot its bad enough from 4th floor I cant imagine what it must be like to live on ground or 1 
 Maybe we all just need to scream back one night
 Doesnt work I did that a few times to the guys at the back gate
 I regularly tell off the people at the front outside my doorstep they tend to scatter when they see me but inevitably they always come back
 Is there any possibility of more guardians using this door as an exit When they see people using the door it might become a deterrent
24092019 100704 Dotdotdot Could work during the day but they normally start tweaking out around 25am thatåäÌİå»s when they wake me anyway what if we wet the steps
24092019 100850 Dotdotdot Water and sugar Sticky steps might make em find a new party spot ÌªÌÁåäÌİååäå»Ì¢
 Security was doing that  Perhaps they stopped  I know Monika is really good about running them off when shes on security but I think shes on hols weve had some temps cuz Rob cant do every night
24092019 101248 Dotdotdot I would happily sticky up those steps
 How do you make that sound obscene Harry

 Tower hamlets recommends reporting antisocial behaviour via this website
 The temps are terrible Ive been running off the ones dealing on our doorstep late at night whilst they look on from inside Although  they may not have got the memo that they need to move them on so that guardians can actually get into the building Ìªå»Ì£ Rob had said he was going to  say something so all were on the same page
24092019 102343 Dotdotdot Alternatively Dionysus recommends that you pray to him to remove rowdy party animals from your domicile
 Thanks Caitlin We went through this with the drug dealers Every person effected needs to keep reporting it so the police community officers  council can allocate resources What happened to the ddd report guardian liaison mentioned a while back
 The website is very easy to use too so if everyone could please report that would be great Thanks
 Sorry doesnt that draw more revelers your way
 I recall ddd also asking us to report it to them too They were having meetings with various groups They can raise it there also
 Can we all club together to hire a doorman one of those fancy ones in Hunter green wool and top hat to stand outside  Sometimes it seems like the druggies dont think any of our doors are in use
24092019 103641 Dotdotdot This would explain a few thing ÌªÌÒ
 That would be really funny Maybe we could all chant the same thing getting louder and louder until they get scared and run away Perhaps costumes too x
 Im in

 Im kidding
 Hey harry that used to be an adequate strategy until the water started leaking into the small laundry I think we should pressure DDD into giving us all access to go in and out of the door Because they know itåäÌİå»s only me they always come back
24092019 133045 Dotdotdot I see I didnåäÌİå»t know thanks for the info IåäÌİå»d be happy to join a complaint

 Not surprising from Fox News but the list of sponsors have shocked me Incredibly poor
 Remember the companies they own too Coca cola owns Costa For me end of Costa coffee buying
 Fox did apologise  Which they hardly ever do and they say all sorts of rubbish

25092019 094200 Dotdotdot This is not an apology They insulted her on international televised news then åäÌİÌapologisedåäÌİå in a written comment in the daily beast Might aswell have written their apology on a bathroom stall door for all the people that will see it
 The story of the apology has been spread far and wide  And Im not judging the quality of the apology  Only sharing a news story
 Will you exchange for 2 cans of chickpeas
 Seriously thank you for this Zoe lifesaver

25092019 095601 Dotdotdot I know Zoe Dw IåäÌİå»m commenting on the story too not commenting on you However a real apology is given in the same way as the offence Televised prime time apology their target audience will not see or care about an anonymous spokesmanåäÌİå»s comments in the daily beast It isnåäÌİå»t even an apology on Fox News itself
 Yo Millys phone is broken so if youåäÌİå»re trying to get in contact add her on facebook ÌªÌá
 You make a good point
 I know someone whose interested She deals in chickpeas currency only IåäÌİå»ve heard itåäÌİå»s the new bitcoin x

 I saw this advertised and would absolutely love to go but workingif theres any chance of me getting off early Ill message you

 Im going to only reason I didnt last time was cos I couldnt get time off work I did sit with them a few of my lunch hours in paternoster square
 They raided their place in Kennington the other day It seems the police have been ordered to be more heavy handed this time
 IåäÌİå»m not back until the following day so will have to tune into the video link Hopefully be able to contribute and discuss my part Very excited for the next one x
 This has been moved to the 20th x
07102019 100220 Tom Dotdotdot Anyone else getting council emails about the HEF form Already registered to vote and dont remember getting a letter not sure if I need to ring them up about this
 Yes I am too and dont think I have received the letter they are talking about If you do ring them can you please let me know the result
 Same here 447801475567  447453235001
 Whats a HEF form  Obviously not getting emails
 Ive got an email too and also already registered to vote Im guessing these letters sent will be addressed to the household rather than individual residents hence none of us receiving one
 I think there were issues before and Ewa spoke to the council
 Is anyone interested in being my theatre buddy on Friday going for a full day of Shakespeare king 4th pt1 2 and henry 5th at Ì´å£5 each
 At the Globe
07102019 120506 Tom Dotdotdot Sounds pretty great what time would it be
128
 Youre STANDING all day
07102019 120619 Tom Dotdotdot Could come for the last one
 Being a groundling is fun because the actors are always entering and exiting through the crowd  I just find it difficult to stand for such a long time  Im old and decrepit
 Can always take a beach chair
 No you cant
 You cant sit on the ground because fire regs
 You can perch somewhere during interval
 But youre young  Youll get so into the show youll forget everything else
 The system is unfortunately a joke and cannot compute our living arrangement Apparently some people at BH received a letter and that counts for the whole house Even though no one guardian can account for all those registered to vote 
I called the council up about this a month ago and they said just wait and youll receive the HEF form I lost my patience a bit because I dont like being threatened with losing my democratic right to vote and she no no that wont happen youll get the form through and guess what  still no form received Anyone whos concerned about this should call up but be warned I was on hold for 25 minutes last time
 Really but in theory DDD pays for all of our councils isnt it At least thats what they told me when Ive signed up If we all count as residents then Im not sure about whats the issue but yeah thanks Rhian for letting us know
 Being a resident doesnt automatically register you on the electoral register You have to register online or via a postal form
 I dont have our guardianship contact to hand but Ill be amazed if DDD register us on our behalf
 DDD pay Council tax  I think the form theyre talking about treated to the electoral roll  The form warns you can be fined Ì´å£1000 for failing to respond You could also ultimately be booted off the electoral register if you dont respond
 Relates  Not treated
 If we could only link them up with the bastards who post re tv license  They manage to mail each unit
 This sound amazing Im game Ive got a visitor from Newcastle she might not be
07102019 124729 Bryce Dotdotdot One HEF form is sent to åäÌİÌThe OccupieråäÌİå at the Booth House address listing everyone who has registered The problem is that DDD have presumably not opened or not responded to that letter
07102019 124856 Bryce Dotdotdot When you register online it has individual addresses for each flat but Tower Hamlets change then to just be the generic Booth House address
 When I spoke to the council they said they had received some responses from our address Suggesting more than one form has been sent
Has anyone completed this form for themselves
 IåäÌİå»m registered but I havenåäÌİå»t received a form
07102019 125808 Bryce Dotdotdot There arenåäÌİå»t shouldnåäÌİå»t be individual forms Just one for åäÌİÌThe OccupieråäÌİå at Booth House which DDD needs to respond to
 DOES ANYONE NEED WOOD
07102019 130917 Jen Dotdotdot yes please

07102019 130944 Christina For kitchen shelving  yes
 Okay Martinspeed are coming tomorrow just want to get an idea
07102019 131642 Tom Dotdotdot Just got through to them and they said its 100 DDDs responsibility not ours I just forwarded them the council email and asked them to call up and stop the threatening emails
 Yes please

 I might try one
08102019 150717 Liang These should be alright   The smell should be less strong
08102019 150800 Liang You love it or hate it  Durian is a strange combination of savory sweet and creamy all at once From wiki
 diced garlic and caramel poured into whipped cream  sounds delightful
 Weird
 Were an odd bunch giving away our sour grapes and garlic sweets ÌªÌáåÊ
 Durian is a McGuffin in WINDSWEPT Its illegal to take them on airplanes  in Thailand because of the smell But durian ice cream is delicious
 Its esssentially like garlic but a million times worse
 Except
 I dont compute worse in relation to garlic
 I dont like the idea of garlic with sugar
08102019 152259 Dotdotdot You give durian to people that you hate because everyone pretends that someone knows someone that likes it
 But garlic with garlic even times a million is still good
 Lol
 But is the entire durian growing industry based on hate

 WINTER SHIVERY QUESTION Hay guys when do we start the heating Do we petition DDD or is there a date or am i a dolt with independently operated radiators Who has info on this I know i can be a bit of a lizard but itåäÌİå»s not just me itåäÌİå»s time for the Q amirite
 I asked the guy who did room inspection today and he wasnåäÌİå»t very clear but said he thought heating should be on any day now
 Perhaps we should ask Kioni
 Hi Alia please add my name to the cardhe may not know who I am but heåäÌİå»s always been nice to me
 I have been thinking the same thing
 Louise said the request went in last week and it takes about 7 days so any day now should be accurate
 Do you need to borrow my lil heater Zoe
 I use it in the hub but Im actually okay in my room with my 3 billion blankets
 To whomever took the bathtub  drain stopper from the bathroom on the  4th floor please be a gentleperson and return it The beautiful decor that Frankie did misses it very much
 Are we giving him his card tomorrow
 Giving it to him tonight b in 5 mins
 Aha thanks all for the info zoe you love we need you warm down there IT has i think some radiators for lizard appropriation btw just wondering if weåäÌİå»d be wrestling for them X
 I dont think theyre there
 Mark brought them up for the meet n greet
 Then I think one went into reception and the other may be locked up in DDD room behind Boothermarket
 Ok then But there were like 10 of them
 Go for it Liz
 I havent checked itåäÌİå»s lazy old info and if the heat goes on soon that is fine and good for me But if mark hasnt melted the radiators into doorstops we can maybe reclaim then and make some sort of sauna
 The rooftop shed
  
 I will all Brian at SAHA tomorrow and reinforce the request for heating and hopefully get some actual real feedback
 call
 There were some in one of the store rooms  perhaps near where rupert had his video installation  but I cant remember where I saw them
 ThereåäÌİå»s a heater in the canteen FYI
 It is coming on any day now

 Babylon
 Yes thats the same as me Jooles  The app is Babylon the NHS service is GP at Hand the app can also be used for private health care  The nearest physical clinics are around Canary Wharf and near Kings Cross for blood tests poking and prodding  You can often get appointments quickly certainly conveniently they have always been within a couple of minutes of on time you can have phone or video chat you can be referred to specialists get prescriptions etc  Ive had a different doctor each time and they havent read my file so that is absolutely no different from going into my previous clinic  Plus you can talk to a doctor even if youre out of town  It takes about 24 hours to get on their roster

 Dear Booth House guardians
We would like to remind all guardians at Booth House of our drugs policy We have recently come across a few separate incidents of illegal drug use in the building Whilst each incident is dealt with individually its important for us to communicate what our drug policy is more widelyÌ´Ì_
There is a zero tolerance on illegal drug use in Booth House and anyone found to be storing possessing or taking drugs in the building puts their housing with Dot Dot Dot at riskÌ´Ì_
Smoking of any kind inside the building is also against our rules our fire regulations and our agreement with the buildingåäÌİå»s owners It also risks setting off the buildingåäÌİå»s sensitive fire alarm system causing great nuisance to all 90 guardians
The buildingåäÌİå»s owners SAHA regularly visit the building If they were to discover any use of illegal drugs in the building this could cause detrimental damage to our relationship with our client and put the whole project at risk This could potentially cause every resident to receive 28 days notice to hand back Booth House and cause Dot Dot Dot substantial reputational damageÌ´Ì_
Drugs are illegal inside Booth House just as they are outside of it Dot Dot Dot have been working hard with other organisations to tackle the antisocial behaviour and obvious drug use outside the building We know many of you have huge concerns about the antisocial behaviour and therefore it is very important we do everything we can to discourage this behaviour Drug use inside Booth House goes directly against our positive work of tackling antisocial behaviour outside the building
Thank you very much for your understanding on this matter and if you need any further clarification please donåäÌİå»t hesitate to get in touch
Dot Dot Dot
 Is this the wrong moment to ask if anyone has any baking soda  ÌªÌáÌâ
 Please come to trafalgar beautiful peoooople åäååäååäå
 Theres some in my cupboard I thinkbottom shelf at the back if I have any you might have to dig a bit
 Hi all I was thinking should we throw a massive Drug Party some time soon Something open to the public I spoke with Dot Dot Dot and they said they would be supportive as long as we keep it legal only drugs with prescription and with outside guests to a minimum ideally zero
 Ill be on decorations
 Tramadol nights

 So tonight  830 2000 Im gonna put Last of the Mohicans on in the lounge
 Just you stay aliveI will find you
 Ive not seen it for years Amazing film and the score is immense
 Just wanted to clarify  are we expected to pay another license fee on top of what we already paid or are they just changing the terminology
 Nah just changing the terms to fit the new law
 According to my letter IåäÌİå»ll have to top mine up by Ì´å£81
 Thats a bit steep
17102019 191133 Jooles Dotdotdot I would get them to double check that ItåäÌİå»s an increase of 3
 I thought we were getting a refund 
 Ohh sorry I get it now
 Your deposit not your monthly right
 Thats the rent increase The deposit fee law has been changed as well I have to top up mines not by nearly that much like
 Im not sure how they calculated the deposit when we moved in but it looks like its just going from 5 weeks at the old rate to 5 weeks at the new rate
 Unless your deposit was low to begin with it should be approx Ì´å£28  Unless my maths are way off
 Hah They want Ì´å£144 from me
 Im getting a cashback
 Yes the deposit  my monthly rent is going up by Ì´å£20 pm
 That sounds right
 Annexers were your deposits not Ì´å£937938 to begin with
 Surely that means you were screwed when you moved in
 CanåäÌİå»t remember and IåäÌİå»m not home so canåäÌİå»t check the paperwork x
 Im just figuring my deposit was about 5 weeks of the current monthly and my deposit increase is 125 of the monthly increase  I tried to do that with what I guessed your costs to be
 Sad to miss this love the film and especially the soundtrack
 ThatåäÌİå»s steep Aslan
 Is that because of your studio
 My rent is going up by Ì´å£70 a month  is it the same for others
 447961427361 447717345724 it is a bit steep but I checked the original deposit and itåäÌİå»s right Ugh
 Ooooh no
 At least thats the bit you should get back as opposed to the license fee
 Wow
 ThatåäÌİå»s a 13 increase and I just moved in IåäÌİå»m not happy at all
 That cant be right should be a 3 increase
 This all seems v confusing
 Maybe itåäÌİå»s a mistake God I hope so
 IåäÌİå»m getting Ì´å£300 back
 Louise is here tomorrow from 2pm
 Doing this 90 times over theres bound to be mistakes  That said there are only 4 different license fees  There should only be 4 different permutations  Except maybe Aslan ÌªÌáÌ_
 Does it make sense to you
 I believe the email said 3 was the average increase and they were looking to establish a clear fee for each unit so whilst some would increase substantially others may decrease with the deposit being brought in line to be 5 weeks The storage rooms were another matter due to the additional admin
 What Did they say why
 Im always getting screwed one way or anotherbut I make it a 3some ÌªÌá
 Something about me being a legendary guardian
 Ìªå£Ìªå£Ìªå£
17102019 203543 Dotdotdot Im paying 15 more a month and getting a Ì´å£98 refund Was we supposed to haggle our deposit
17102019 203656 Dotdotdot Or a social experiment on fee compliance
 Thanks for all the hellos guys
 Any recommendations for a man with a van service
 
 Bam had an inexpensive one  Hes not in the group though so Ill ask him
 I have a brilliant man with a van Will PM you
 Me too Allison Thanks
 Dont Bogart men with ven you two  We all need one eventually
 How much did you initially pay
 Im a bit confused about this too the amounts in the email dont make sense to me either
 I will be paying just Ì´å£18 more and I will get Ì´å£66 cashback I think my deposit was for 6 weeks if I remember correctly
17102019 222421 Bryce Dotdotdot Sounds like a mistake unless you are somehow paying less than others with the same room type
17102019 222435 Bryce Dotdotdot But either way 13 isnåäÌİå»t right
17102019 222547 Bryce Dotdotdot Mine went up by Ì´å£15 which is slightly less than 3 I originally paid a Ì´å£750 deposit and they want Ì´å£17 more to take it up to 5 weeks which is correct
 I think I figured it out  IåäÌİå»m due to start paying extra for a storage room in November for the first time which theyåäÌİå»ve factored into my new price which is why it looked like such a big leap
17102019 222645 Bryce Dotdotdot That makes sense
17102019 222755 Bryce Dotdotdot But how much are you getting from Three after last nights debacle You could be rich
 My internet still doesnt work right  Cant stream websites time out

 Gang can I ask a question  Who uses the movement studio on 2D now Saras gone
19102019 133816 Jen Dotdotdot I heard a few people talking about making it into a sewing and crafts room
 You arent wrong  I wanted to check how inconvenient that would be for current users and if there was a better arrangement
 No furniture in movement studio please IT is ideal for crafts
 IT is earmarked for other things
 The 2D space is empty on purpose and needs to stay that way
 Not available
 Ok yeah just a thought
 It was a good thought
 I can join you Leaving Earls Court now Where can I find you in half an hour
 Does anyone know how it works if you decide to give up your storage room Do you have to give them notice
 We are in parliament square at the foot of Churchill  behind the statue
 Nope just clear it and hand keys back

Well also find a way that you can check other than on this group whatåäÌİå»s happening down there before you let a party happen

 This applies to everyone not just one person I named Oscar cuz it was his friends but we can all be more aware in shared spaces so itåäÌİå»s fine to send it in this group
20102019 122747 Jen Dotdotdot Sounds like a one off though if it was happening constantly then its a house issue but a one off mistake by one person is more respectful addressed privately
 Well itåäÌİå»s more respectful to not leave broken glass litter and drunk friends asleep in communalwork areas Not fair on guests not fair on people living and working here respectfully

 Guys do your radiators work I think it s about time DDD turns them on 
 Apparently its happening soon
 Theyve been saying for a fortnight any day now Theyre being tight and trying to save coin
 Thx for the update guys
 Anyone have their carvan here could you PM me please
20102019 212014 Bryce Dotdotdot I donåäÌİå»t blame them the gas bill must have been astronomical last year With all the valves opened up and heating empty rooms on full blast all the time
 Did they shut the radiators off in empty rooms I might ask tomorrow
 It was the engineers fault they just missed us out  Keoni was chasing up Thursday
20102019 213238 Bryce Dotdotdot The opposite Valves turned to full and windows left open to dump the heat Due to it being a crappy faulty system apparently This building has the carbon emissions of a small town
 If we didnt keep the empty room stair radiators on full blast half the boothers would have a singing kettle on in the room all night
  true
 They wont shell out for new system
 They wont give Keoni a date just well set it up itll be about a week
 Shes chasing up again today
 My personal thoughts are they will tear the building down or kick us out for a full redo before theyll give us any major upgrades
 Anyone have any spare cardboard boxes Preferably not too big and more square
 Is anyone hiring a van over the next couple of days or willing to chip in for one I need to pick a couch up
 Glenn if you can wait till Thursday I have a few in my storage room
 From SAHA re heating

 Wonderful news
 I left Mark Muldoon a screaming voicemail regarding the heating situation I suggest all 90 guardians take a leaf out of my proverbial book Needless to say he has yet to return my call
24102019 165148 Jen Dotdotdot I got his out of office today
24102019 165157 Jen Dotdotdot I think hes away Ìªå£
 He left for 3 weeks right after the meet n greet
 Bahahaaaahaaa do we think he might be a wee bit traumatised

 Btw just got off the phone with an extremely exasperated Louise I demanded more heaters and a discount on the fee for this month and next month if the situation is not sorted by then Received corporate mumbo jumbo in response
24102019 170447 Dotdotdot I want to thank you for speaking up ÌªÌÓåÌªå
 No thanks needed My big fat mouth needs constant exercise IåäÌİå»ll be phoning again tomorrow if theyåäÌİå»ve not emailed us all an update on the situation which is what she promised

 Hi guys  Pete has just posted a long and specific message about the wiring in the building in the maintenance chat which I will summarise here
DONT TOUCH THE ELECTRICALS
Even if you know what youre doing the building is possessed
Okay he didnt say possessed  I see Frankie has just suggested topsy turvy  Which seems precise enough for our purposes

 Dear Booth House guardians
nan
We first raised a works order for the heating to be switched on on the 9th October I have escalated the lack of heating at Booth House and have been assured an engineer will attend next Tuesday 29th to get the heating workingÌ´Ì_
nan
I am sorry this is taking longer than expected to sort out and I know many of you have been cold We have a limited amount of heaters left to hand out If you do need one for the time being please ask at reception These will be handed out on a first come first served basis until theyre gone We would like these heaters back once Booth House becomes warm and toasty again
nan
Thank you for your continued patience with this
nan
Kind Regards
nan

 Check D corridor  saw some about 2 weeks ago may have been shoved somewhere
 2D
 I might take mine off the wall I dont like it it irritates me Ill give you a shout if I do
 Regarding the cold
I frankly dont think the situation is good enough but I doubt screaming will improve things  Its Friday  Ive looked at the weather forecast  Tonight and tomorrow are not too bad but Sunday night will be similar to last night close to freezing  Ive got either a space heater or a small heating pad the kind you put on a strained muscle not a bedsized hot blanket I can share and extra duvets and blankets  
If youre suffering in your rooms let me know  If you have heat to spare shout out
 Im not in this weekend so happy to donate my little heater to someone for a few days
25102019 114013 Jen Dotdotdot in the mean time SLUMBER PARTY ANYONE
25102019 114058 Jen Dotdotdot on a serious note i love it when the room is cold at night and I combat it by wearing a hoodie and trackies and having two duvets
25102019 114112 Jen Dotdotdot i only just closed my window for the first time last night Ìªå«å_
 I had thought that too
 Im warm enough sleeping  Its getting out in the morning I struggle with
 My rooms toastie warm I think It might be something to do with me being ill
 Thats something of a mixed message Chris  Are you trying to entice people into your room or warning them off
 Sadly or luckily depending on your view they seem to have gone
 Hes a complicated man
 Im pretty sure I heard a scuttling sound about 10 minutes ago
 I dont actually touch those and dont mind them being dumped as they are always recycled and needed by guardians Its the sneaky fly tipping of broken ish and random crap that turns me into the hulk

 Screaming helps but doesnåäÌİå»t sort shit out 447717345724 I agree I need to actually work out what our legal rights are as guardians as I have a sneaky feeling that DDD is responsible for ensuring that we allllllllllll have adequate heating not this åäÌİÌfirst come first serveåäÌİå bullshit Anyone up for being an amateur solicitor
 I will forfeit my place in order to take responsibility for SCIENCE Ìªå_å
 I am not sure we do have rights there my last guardianship didnt have heating that worked and we all bought our own heaters

 Hey all The clothes rail from the Boother market has been taken Can it be returned please
 Hey Millie if you dont have a plan for the insides of the pumpkin  theres a ÌªÌÓÌ_cake recipe  so give me a shout ÌªÌã ÌªååÁ
 Of anyones doing a white wash in the next couple of days can I put a shirt in please Need it for an interview but dont wanna do a full wash for 1 shirt
 I wanna do my bedsheets on Tue or Wed Because my friend Karolina will arrive on Thursday But you might find someone washing whites earlier
 Looks like Master Chief of The Opera
 Ah nice I was thinking about making some pumpkin muffins but I dont think I will have time so Ill save the insides for you
 Where about in basement I tried to find you
 Where da peeps
 Were postponing for a couple of hours
 I saw a clothes rail in the event in the canteen earlier
 I spoke to the organizer who said they would return the rails and rehang the clothes
 Do we know what the event was or who was responsible for it
 Its all good
 That does not answer my question but thank you for your opinion
 Its a Hillsong thing I felt a certain way letting all these women in because I had no idea if they were lying or not Difficult to stop 20 women entering the building when youve opened the door
 åäÌİimage omitted
 Is pumpkin carving now
 Nice ÌªÌãÌªå_Ì
 Ive got the tools if you have a pumpkin Ill be doing mine at 6 still have to go buy some
 Hey I LOVE that the space is getting used like this but did I miss the memo it was happening  447399305613  Because sometimes even I cant keep up with the messages
 I missed this memo What was the memo What is Hillsong Where is the remedial class
 I missed memo also
 Anyone wanna repost for kids in the back
 Okay Im willing to believe there wasnt a memo not that I just didnt read it
 In case there was no memo
 Could we please shoot out a message when we are using communal spaces for events because DDD arent going to do it
 One of the ladies mentioned it was a paid for space so I assume its definitely DDDs responsibility to let us know
 I think a Guardian helped organise so there was probably a misunderstanding about who would pass on word to the residents
 I think it should always be assumed its your responsibility to get the word out
 Thats safest
 The woman promised that the rails would be replaced and all the clothes would be rehung as they were
They obviously were not
The upside is that sharon and I get an extra hour or two of volunteering restoring the Boother Market to its  original condition
 OK Well this certainly needs to be raised
Thank you 447870497809 And Sharon
 I had a chat with Heather and Rachel who were connected to the event and were very nice and forthcoming and conscientious
They were in the process of organizing the Market back to the state they had found it
At some point before they had arrived apparently someone had shifted the rails and shoved the Hoovers around and clothes were added to the pile
So no fault on the part of the seminar
 If itåäÌİå»s still going IåäÌİå»d love this

 Is there a spare wardrobe floating around
 Hello everyone I seem to have misplaced my glasses over the weekend They are clear plastic one frames
 Good morning all
 The guy from fire service is here
 Terry
 Apparently thats why the remaining lift is out of service
 Or fire brigade
 No it isnt
 I dont know  Hes a bit of an arse
 IåäÌİå»ll come over
 Anyway hes complaining that the fire cupboards in all the kitchens save floor 1 are blocked
 Is it the older gentleman with glasses
 He says if rescue needs access they wont carefully move things theyll chuck out of the way
 Yes
 Hes going to talk to Louise later so expect to get word the kitchens need to be reorganised to provide 247 access
 He was lovely to me I made him a latte
 You are a nicer person than I am  I think we all knew that
 ItåäÌİå»s just a facade my dear IåäÌİå»m really a mad axe murderer But I like to think IåäÌİå»m polite to my victims 
I think your super duper nice zo åäÌáå_
 What really matters is what people think of you  Not who you are deep down  Right
 Most philosophical conclusion IåäÌİå»ve ever heard in my entire life I shall now be extremely careful regarding how strangers construct their perceptions of me NOT Maniacal laughter for disturbing effect
 IåäÌİå»m with Terry now sorting out DDD Work lol
 Pete is contraband in human form
 Class A DRUGZ
 Any advice for a rude health centre receptionist who refuses to acknowledge my existence and find my fucken patient I donåäÌİå»t think punching is a clever option in this scenario

 After discussions with Serge and other Boothers in an ongoing campaign to tidy up Boother Market yellow vacuum cleaners are now in orange cupboard in lounge
 If anyone has right to work in Mexico is a fluent Spanish speaker and has proficient financial modelling skills hmu
28102019 111048 Bryce Dotdotdot Hmm could a better place be found closer to the lifts Basement The lounge adds a lot of extra hassle and we already have problems with them not being returned
28102019 111135 Bryce Dotdotdot Also I would argue that having the hoovers in Boothmarket brings more åäÌİÌcustomersåäÌİå to the Boothmarket Retail is all about footfall

 Hi all  as some of you know I am going to leave London soon for a month until XMas time unsure yet of nye plans and then will be back for real in January I will leave these chat rooms for the moment being and will join back when Im back I will still be around for a couple of weeks and reachable via pm during that time Sid åäÌÌ_

 ÌªÌÓåÌªå»ÌÏ lucky you
 Hi  Bryce
Were more than open to places to put the hoovers
But people often just dump them and block the door and floor space And this weekend somebody left the room in complete chaos moving rails around to leave Hoovers against the wall
Its actually easier to take them out of the cupboard than out of the Boother Market
But whatever is the most convenient alternative to all is fine
 It would seem more toilet rolls have been taken from SergieåäÌİå»s storage in basement He is on the warpath and we may well end up in same situation as previously with DDD all over cards again 
I asked him to give me some time to resolve with DDD getting involved  
If it is you FFS please contact me and letåäÌİå»s discuss This time around there could be serious consequences
 Erron a completely unrelated note and perhaps a little premature but are there any plans for a Booth Xmas meal etc again
 without DDD getting involved
 Isnt Serges cupboard locked  I couldnt get in if I wanted to
 Of course there are more than one
 What about putting Hoovers in the glassed in area under the stairs in the basement  Its always unlocked
 Excellent My mum and sis are going to spend Xmas here YES I CONTROL CHRISTMAS and a big ol meal with you folk might convince them Im not entirely wasting my life
 Lucky for you I spend Christmas away
 Or depending on who they sit next to reaffirm their beliefs

 I love this initiative and sorry to miss the last one i have a few sundays spoken for my only suggestion is maybe sometimes alternate the roast concept with brunch Like where we all drink mimosas and have fancy poached eggs and gossip in big earrings Or is the program already open to that X

Anyone here who knows someone that works for Foxtons or other estate agents
Asking for Ewa Ìªå»Ì¢
 Fenya
The real estate market in the UK is very screwy
Estate agents only deal with specific properties in a very limited geographic area Foxtons tried to impose their system on high end properties in Manhattan and it was a wellknown catastrophic failure
 Is Ewa looking to buy sell rent or other
Amazingly enough  the guy responsible for the New York debacle still has his job at Foxtons and I know an agent who works for him
Ps Have you ever been to Naxos ÌªÌ_å

 Nathan the resident physicist mathematician and quiz master extraordinaire
 Simple harmonic oscillator if IåäÌİå»m not much mistaken which I probably fucken am
 Bring this to me
 Pendulum  So yeah probably
 Also known as pendulum equation and potentially sinusoidal wave equation but not sure I am borat incarnated after all
 So what is the inverse of an harmonic oscillator  Write that sounds so Doctor Who
 Wow not write you stupid phone
 I get sinusoidal waves in the winter
 IåäÌİå»ll ask the smarty pants I work form I simply pretend to know maths when I genuinely donåäÌİå»t have the foggiest idea whatåäÌİå»s going on Might as well be speaking Eskimo for all the sense I can make out of if ÌªÌáÌ¢

 Has anyone played Disco Elysium
 No but intrigued because it has Disco in the name

 Apparently it is retro
 Its an open world detective RPG for PCMac porting to PS4 and XBox One next year  I play very few video games but this has been very highly rated
 Read up about it sounds really cool

 I think IåäÌİå»m missing out here Zoe  WhatåäÌİå»s a DD campaign
 Dungeons and Dragons is the original tabletop role playing game  Think of it like a choose your own adventure crossed with improv  You create a character from Tolkienesque species ie Im dragonborn Anyas halfOrc you can also be human with certain skills  You can create a whole backstory and personality which determine how you behave in the adventure  The Dungeon Master is basically the storyteller explaining where you are what you see and the results of your actions  You use dice to determine if youre successful or unsuccessful in your choices
 Our DM Billy understands the mechanics but the rest of us are newbies so perfect for someone just learning
 Thanks Zoe x
 It sounds like fun but IåäÌİå»m not around tonight x

 In terms of needing prescriptions and referrals does that actually work
 As well as any other NHS service
 I created an account with  pharmacy2u and they immediately became my pharmacy of record and they deliver to the house yes add a couple of days or you can use the one on the corner  Was referred to a specialist that worked the same as when I was with a bricks and mortar GP
 There are 5 physical locations for exams and tests and a womens clinic
 Because the GP may be based anywhere getting an appointment is super easy
 Theyve wont have read your file so no change there

   Roast dinner at 2pm this Sunday
              Please join the group 
 and add your name in the description
         No money options available 
                 Everyone welcome
This week is with a twist
A roast is an English tradition but with such a diverse mix of housemates we would like to introduce alternative dishes This week allow the roasted meat and veggies be the baseline and then letåäÌİå»s see what else gets added
Coming soon every other Sunday will become a different cuisine If you would like to head up a particular cuisine please get in touch and letåäÌİå»s make it happen 
httpschatwhatsappcomHbN3X9nfNlKGhcOXQfYS1k
 PLAN AHEAD SUNDAY
So you already know about the Boothfamily dinner at 2
This will be followed by Canteen Crafting  Bring something youre working on for the art fair something youve been putting off something youre not sure how to do or brainstorm with your corridormates on how youre going to decorate  Or just hang out
Then at 7 its SUPERHERO SUNDAY in the lounge  I think were on Age of Ultron but its anybodys guess
 åäå SundayåäÌİå»s are now my favourite day of the week
 Dammit IåäÌİå»m working
